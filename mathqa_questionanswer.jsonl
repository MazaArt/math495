{"question": "of the 17,210 employees of the anvil factory , 2 / 7 are journeymen . if half of the journeymen were laid off , what percentage of the total remaining employees would be journeymen ?", "answer": "\"the exam gives us a number that is easily divisible by 7 to pique our curiosity and tempt us into calculating actual numbers ( also because otherwise the ratio would be incorrect ) . since the question is about percentages , the actual numbers will be meaningless , as only the ratio of that number versus others will be meaningful . nonetheless , for those who are curious , each 1 / 7 portion represents ( 14210 / 7 ) 2,030 employees . this in turn means that 4,060 employees are journeymen and the remaining 10,150 are full time workers . if half the journeymen were laid off , that would mean 1 / 7 of the total current workforce would be removed . this statistic is what leads many students to think that since half the journeymen are left , the remaining journeymen would represent half of what they used to be , which means 1 / 7 of the total workforce . if 1 / 7 of the workforce is journeymen , and 1 / 7 is roughly 14.3 % , then answer choice a should be the right answer . in this case , though , it is merely the tempting trap answer choice . what changed between the initial statement and the final tally ? well , you let go of 1 / 7 of the workforce , so the total number of workers went down . the remaining workers are still 1 / 7 of the initial workers , but the group has changed . the new workforce is smaller than the original group , specifically 6 / 7 of it because 1 / 7 was eliminated . the remaining workers now account for 1 / 7 out of 6 / 7 of the force , which if we multiply by 7 gives us 1 out of 6 . this number as a percentage is answer choice b , 28.6 % . using the absolute numbers we calculated before , there were 4,060 journeymen employees out of 14,210 total . if 2,030 of them are laid off , then there are 2,030 journeyman employees left , but now out of a total of ( 14,210 - 2,030 ) 12,180 employees . 2,030 / 12,180 is exactly 1 / 6 , or 16.67 % . the answer will work with either percentages or absolute numbers , but the percentage calculation will be significantly faster and applicable to any similar situation . the underlying principle of percentages ( and , on a related note , ratios ) can be summed up in the brainteaser i like to ask my students : if you ’ re running a race and you overtake the 2 nd place runner just before the end , what position do you end up in ? the correct answer is 2 nd place . percentages , like ratios and other concepts of relative math , depend entirely on the context . whether 100 % more of something is better than 50 % more of something else depends on the context much more than the percentages quoted . when it comes to percentages on the gmat , the goal is to understand them enough to instinctively not fall into the traps laid out for you . d\""}
